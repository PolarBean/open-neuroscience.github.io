10,0,Heuristic Spike Sorting Tuner (HSST) https://github.com/davidbjanes/hsst  ... 🧵
10,1,Extracellular microelectrodes frequently record neural activity from more than one neuron in the vicinity of the electrode.
10,2,"The process of labeling each recorded spike waveform with the identity of its source neuron is called spike sorting and is often approached from an abstracted statistical perspective. However, these approaches do not consider neurophysiological realities and may ignore important features that could improve the accuracy of these methods."
10,3,"Further, standard algorithms typically require selection of at least one free parameter, which can have significant effects on the quality of the output."
10,4,We describe a Heuristic Spike Sorting Tuner (HSST) that determines the optimal choice of the free parameters for a given spike sorting algorithm based on the neurophysiological qualification of unit isolation and signal discrimination. A set of heuristic metrics are used to score the output of a spike sorting algorithm over a range of free parameters resulting in optimal sorting quality.
10,5,"We demonstrate that these metrics can be used to tune parameters in several spike sorting algorithms. The HSST algorithm shows robustness to variations in signal to noise ratio, number and relative size of units per channel."

69,1,PsychRNN is designed for neuroscientists and psychologists who are interested in RNNs as models of cognitive function in the brain.
69,2,"Despite growing interest in RNNs as models of brain function, this approach poses relatively high barriers to entry to researchers, due to the technical know-how required for specialized deep learning software (e.g. TensorFlow or PyTorch) to train artificial neural network models. We designed PsychRNN with accessibility and flexibility as important goals."
69,3,"The frontend for users to define tasks and train RNNs uses only Python & NumPy, with no requirement for deep learning software. The backend, based on TensorFlow for model training, is readily extensible."
69,4,"This design allows for accessible high-level specification and parameterization of tasks and models, using only a few lines of Python. Modularity is central to PsychRNN's design, to achieve flexibility in defining and parameterizing tasks and networks."
69,5,This facilitates investigation of how task features (e.g. timing or input/output channels) shape the network solutions learned by the models.
69,6,"PsychRNN also provides support for implementation of neurobiologically motivated constraints on synaptic connectivity, such as: no autapses, structured connectivity (e.g. for multi-region RNNs), Dale's principle (separate excitatory & inhibitory cells), and fixed nonplastic subset of synapses. Modularity enables implementation of curriculum learning, or task shaping. RNNs can be trained in closed-loop, with tasks progressively adjusted as behavioral performance improves."

71,1,BrainSMASH is a Python-based framework for quantifying the significance of a brain map’s spatial topography in studies of large-scale brain organization.
71,2,BrainSMASH was designed to generate synthetic brain maps with spatial autocorrelation (SA) matched to the SA of a target brain map. SA is a prominent and ubiquitous property of brain maps that violates the assumptions of independence/exchangeability that underlie many conventional statistical tests.
71,3,Controlling for this property is therefore necessary to disambiguate meaningful topographic relationships from chance associations.
71,4,"To this end, BrainSMASH instantiates a generative null model for simulating surrogate brain maps, constrained by empirical data, that preserve the SA of cortical (surface-based), subcortical (volumetric), parcellated, and dense brain maps. BrainSMASH requires only two inputs: a brain map of interest, and a matrix of pairwise distances between elements of the brain map."
71,5,"How these inputs are derived is left to user discretion, though additional support has been provided for investigators working with HCP-compliant neuroimaging files."
71,6,"Specifically, BrainSMASH includes routines to generate two-dimensional Euclidean and geodesic distance matrices from surface geometry (GIFTI) files, and subcortical Euclidean distance matrices from CIFTI-format neuroimaging files.

85,6,"The only costs are from the hardware components such as the camera (Genie Nano M640 NIR, Teledyne DALSA, ~$450, ~730 frames per second) and infrared light source, an articulated arm to position the camera (Manfrotto: $130), a computer with one or more gigabit network interface cards, and a power over ethernet switch to power and receive data from the camera."
85,7,"By using the GigE-V Framework to capture the frames from the DALSA camera and the OpenCV simple blob detector, openEyeTrack can accurately estimate the position and area of the pupil. We include pupil size calculations because of its putative link to arousal levels and emotions of the subject."

92,0,Efficient training of mice on the 5-choice serial reaction time task in an automated rodent training system https://github.com/hangyabalazs/ATS  ... 🧵
92,1,"Experiments aiming to understand sensory-motor systems, cognition and behavior necessitate training animals to perform complex tasks."
92,2,"Traditional training protocols require lab personnel to move the animals between home cages and training chambers, to start and end training sessions, and in some cases, to hand-control each training trial. Human labor not only limits the amount of training per day, but also introduces several sources of variability and may increase animal stress."
92,3,"Here we present an automated training system for the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT), a classic rodent task often used to test sensory detection, sustained attention and impulsivity."
92,4,"We found that full automation without human intervention allowed rapid, cost-efficient training, and decreased stress as measured by corticosterone levels. Training breaks introduced only a transient drop in performance, and mice readily generalized across training systems when transferred from automated to manual protocols."
92,5,"We further validated our automated training system with wireless optogenetics and pharmacology experiments, expanding the breadth of experimental needs our system may fulfill."
92,6,"Our automated 5CSRTT system can serve as a prototype for fully automated behavioral training, with methods and principles transferrable to a range of rodent tasks."

93,0,OPETH: Open Source Solution for Real-Time Peri-Event Time Histogram Based on Open Ephys https://github.com/hangyabalazs/opeth  ... 🧵
93,1,Single cell electrophysiology remains one of the most widely used approaches of systems neuroscience.
93,2,"Decisions made by the experimenter during electrophysiology recording largely determine recording quality, duration of the project and value of the collected data. Therefore, online feedback aiding these decisions can lower monetary and time investment, and substantially speed up projects as well as allow novel studies otherwise not possible due to prohibitively low throughput."
93,3,Real-time feedback is especially important in studies that involve optogenetic cell type identification by enabling a systematic search for neurons of interest.
93,4,"However, such tools are scarce and limited to costly commercial systems with high degree of specialization, which hitherto prevented wide-ranging benefits for the community. To address this, we present an open-source tool that enables online feedback during electrophysiology experiments and provides a Python interface for the widely used Open Ephys open source data acquisition system."
93,5,"Specifically, our software allows flexible online visualization of spike alignment to external events, called the online peri-event time histogram (OPETH)."
93,6,"These external events, conveyed by digital logic signals, may indicate photostimulation time stamps for in vivo optogenetic cell type identification or the times of behaviorally relevant events during in vivo behavioral neurophysiology experiments. Therefore, OPETH allows real-time identification of genetically defined neuron types or behaviorally responsive populations."
93,7,"By allowing ""hunting"" for neurons of interest, OPETH significantly reduces experiment time and thus increases the efficiency of experiments that combine in vivo electrophysiology with behavior or optogenetic tagging of neurons."

94,0,Open Source Tools for Temporally Controlled Rodent Behavior Suitable for Electrophysiology and Optogenetic Manipulations https://github.com/hangyabalazs/Rodent_behavior_setup  ... 🧵
94,1,Understanding how the brain controls behavior requires observing and manipulating neural activity in awake behaving animals. Neuronal firing is timed at millisecond precision.
94,2,"Therefore, to decipher temporal coding, it is necessary to monitor and control animal behavior at the same level of temporal accuracy. However, it is technically challenging to deliver sensory stimuli and reinforcers as well as to read the behavioral responses they elicit with millisecond precision."
94,3,"Presently available commercial systems often excel in specific aspects of behavior control, but they do not provide a customizable environment allowing flexible experimental design while maintaining high standards for temporal control necessary for interpreting neuronal activity."
94,4,"Moreover, delay measurements of stimulus and reinforcement delivery are largely unavailable."
94,5,"We combined microcontroller-based behavior control with a sound delivery system for playing complex acoustic stimuli, fast solenoid valves for precisely timed reinforcement delivery and a custom-built sound attenuated chamber using high-end industrial insulation materials. Together this setup provides a physical environment to train head-fixed animals, enables calibrated sound stimuli and precisely timed fluid and air puff presentation as reinforcers."
94,6,We provide latency measurements for stimulus and reinforcement delivery and an algorithm to perform such measurements on other behavior control systems.
94,7,"Combined with electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations, the millisecond timing accuracy will help interpret temporally precise neural signals and behavioral changes."
94,8,"Additionally, since software and hardware provided here can be readily customized to achieve a large variety of paradigms, these solutions enable an unusually flexible design of rodent behavioral experiments."
