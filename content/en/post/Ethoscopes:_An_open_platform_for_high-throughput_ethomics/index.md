Ethoscopes are complete system for high-throughput analysis of behaviour. Developed for Drosophila experiments, the system is based on the Rasberry Pi and Arduino, and providing software for automated analysis using machine learning algorithms. It can also deliver stimulus in real-time in a feedback loop mode.
