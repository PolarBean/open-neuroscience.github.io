NeuroMatic is a collection of WaveMetrics Igor Pro software tools for acquiring, analyzing and simulating electrophysiological data. By merging a wide range of tools into a single package, NeuroMatic facilitates a more integrated style of research. Being open source and of modular design, NeuroMatic allows users to develop their own analysis functions that can be easily incorporated into NeuroMatic’s framework.
