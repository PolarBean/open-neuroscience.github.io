This repository contains the code of the Neuronal Spike Shapes (NSS), a simple approach for analyzing the electrophysiological profiles of cells based on their Action Potential (AP) waveforms. The NSS method explores the heterogeneity of cell types and states by summarizing the AP waveform into a triangular representation complemented by a set of derived electrophysiological (EP) features.
