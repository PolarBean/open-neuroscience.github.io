SqueakR is an open-source R package, available on CRAN, which streamlines bioacoustics research through automated data processing and visualizations for rodent vocalizations exported from DeepSqueak.

These functions are harnessed through the 'SqueakR' Shiny Dashboard, available as a function within the package, which can be used to visualize experimental results and analyses, as well as conduct statistical significance test between call features across groups.
