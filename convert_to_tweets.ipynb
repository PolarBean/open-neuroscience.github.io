       " 'jsPsych is a JavaScript library for running behavioral experiments in a web browser. The library provides a flexible framework for building a wide range of laboratory-like experiments that can be run online. To use jsPsych, you provide a description of the experiment in the form of a timeline. jsPsych handles things like determining which trial to run next, storing data, and randomization. jsPsych uses plugins to define what to do at each point on the timeline. Plugins are ready-made templates for simple experimental tasks like displaying instructions or displaying a stimulus and collecting a keyboard response. Plugins are very flexible to support a wide variety of experiments. It is easy to create your own plugin if you have experience with JavaScript programming.\\n',\n",

       " 'With YAPiC you can make your own customized filter (also called model or classifier) to enhance a certain structure of your choice with a simple Python based command line interface, installable with pip. We have used YAPiC so far for analyzing various microscopy image data. Our experiments are mainly related to neurobiology, cell biology, histopathology and drug discovery (high content screening). However, YAPiC is a very generally applicable tool and can be applied to very different domains. It could be used for detecting e.g. forest regions in satellite images, clouds in landscape photographs or fried eggs in food photography. \\n',\n",
