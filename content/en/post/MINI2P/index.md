MINI2P is an open-source miniature 2-photon microscope brain explorer for fast high-resolution calcium imaging in freely-moving mice.

In brief
Development of a miniature 2-photon miniscope for large-scale calcium imaging in freely moving mice allows stable simultaneous recording of more than a thousand cells across multiple planes of densely active cortical regions in a wide spectrum of behavioral tasks without impediment of the animal's behavior.

Highlights
- We made a light-weight 2-photon miniscope for calcium imaging in freely moving mice

- Stable high-quality imaging was observed during a wide spectrum of behaviours

- Activity can be monitored in volumes of over 1,000 visual or entorhinal-cortex cells

- A custom-designed z-scanning module allows fast imaging across multiple planes
