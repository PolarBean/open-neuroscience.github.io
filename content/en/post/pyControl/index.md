Open source, Python based, behavioural experiment control.

pyControl is a system of open source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments, built around the Micropython microcontroller.

pyControl makes it easy to program complex behavioural tasks using a clean, intuitive, and flexible syntax for specifying tasks as state machines. User created task definition files, written in Python, run directly on the microcontroller, supported by pyControl framework code. This gives users the power and simplicity of Python for specifying task behaviour, while allowing advanced users low-level access to the microcontroller hardware.

pyControl hardware consists of a breakout board and a set of devices such as nose-pokes, audio boards, LED drivers, rotary encoders and stepper motor controllers that are connected to the breakout board to create behavioural setups. Assembled pyControl hardware is available from the OpenEphys store.

pyControl has a Graphical User Interface for controlling experiments and visualing behaviour.
