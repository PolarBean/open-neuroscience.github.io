We wanted a clean performance, as well as a clean video record, so we consider necessary to interfere neither with the animal attention (mice, how they are!) nor the camera’s field of view. I decided then to give a try to the new hobby I was getting into, “Do-It-Yourself” (DIY) stuff.\nIn my head, it was pictured very simple. At the end of the day, I just needed a) something to detect the animal passing by, b) something to deliver a drop of water and c) something to make it happen in a coordinated way. And that’s what Autoreward2 is, no more, no less.\nWell perhaps it is a bit more. So far, the project can:\n Detect when the animal reaches the end of any of the two arms. Deliver a small drop of fluid through the corresponding licking port (easy to make it happen in the opposite, if wanted). Give visual cues to the experimenter, indicating which arm has been reached. Allow to select different modes of working for different working protocols: ‘Waiting for selection’, ‘Habituation’, ‘Training’, ‘Experimental’ and “Filling and cleaning” modes (and is ready to include more!).  To achieve it, I decided for very simple approach. A couple of cheap infrared emitters are continuously read by an UNO R3 board. Breaking any of the beams triggers the signal to open the corresponding solenoid valve, connected to the fluid tank. That lets the liquid flow by gravity for around 75 milliseconds, resulting in a single drop at the tip of the licking port.\n There is a delay after each detection, to avoid repetitive delivery if animals don’t leave the area. A couple LEDs mounted in the bare-board (out of animal sight) light up when the process is triggered, one for each side. They also work as indicators for the ‘Waiting for selection’ mode, when they are continuously on, meanwhile no option is choose or the ‘return to waiting mode action’ is pressed.\nThe selection is made through a 4×4 membrane keypad. Right now, only options 1 to 4 are programmed, making up to 12 more programs available! When any section is made, the in-built LED blinks the corresponding times and the system is ready to work. At any moment, pressing any key makes the system reset to the waiting mode. As easy as that.\nEverything is powered by a regular 9V wall adapter, giving 3.3V to the LEDs and Infrared detectors, and 9V to the solenoids. Of course, it is possible to use a 9V batterie to power it. To avoid damage coming from the solenoid discharges, the circuit is protected by a couple of diodes at this level.\nAnd that’s all, it’s simple. The most important thing: it works. The other most important thing: it costs around 80€. Here is the to-buy list (or equivalent):\n Elegoo UNO R3 (I found them for 10€, with USB cable) BreadBoard + Acrylic base (7€) 9V 1A Wall power supply (9€) 2x InfraRed beams, 5mm (15€ both, the 3mm ones are even cheaper) 2x Mini-Solenoid valves (10€ both) 2x red LEDs 4x 1 KΩ resistors 2x TIP120 Transistors 2x 1N4001 diodes Wiring (set of jumpers for less than 10€) ‘Velcro’ to attach the acrylic base where the boards are mounted. Plastic tubing and laboratory sample tubes, modified with turning siringe tips to attach/deattach the tubing easily. 2x or 4x weak magnets to fix the tubes to the walls.   Feel free to access the Github page or the Arduino forum post to obtain the code, check for the circuit sketch, and see some pictures.\nPD: If someone is scandalized by the code, I am getting better on it, it is not my main strength. Please, improve it! Of course, I have in mind many possible upgrades such as a screen, a SD card port, to change the Keypad for a wireless interface (tactile?) … Did someone say smartphone plus Bluetooth? Going fancy, a barcode reader to easily introduce subjects’ data… And here is where I relay in the open-access idea, I offer it and hopefully someone implement any of the ideas.

Or, you can use StateScript, which allows users with minimal programming experience define complex input/output relationships for the most demanding hardware control experiments.\n This open-source project now runs on two available hardware platforms, the MBED LPC1768 micro controller board ($50) and the SpikeGadgets electrophysiology and behavioral control system. More hardware support in is the works.

One of the very things being decentralized is the funding source for research projects. This movement is called crowdfunding, and it is already present and strong for other areas, such as funding of technological, and social projects. They are organized via specialised websites that puts people needing funding with people who are willing to support it:\nThe idea is somewhat simple. Researchers make a video of what their project/research idea is and ask for a certain value to fund the project. If people find the idea interesting they make a donation via the website hosting that project.\nThere are normally two types of funding options, fixed, where the researchers only get the money pledged if the donations reach that value (or pass it, and if the minimum is not reached the money is returned to the pledgers), or variable where the researchers get to keep the money raised even if it didn’t reach the amount pledged for. In both cases the website keeps a percentage of the money raised in case the funding is successful.\nArticles about it can be founded here and here\nSome crowdfunding sources are listed below:\nhttp://www.sciencestarter.de/ – Research crowdfunding portal based in germany\n https://www.microryza.com/ – Research crowdFunding portal based in the US. (update – this is now called experiment.com)\n www.kickstarter.com – A Crowdfunding portal that also works for science projects.

Here is a short list of projects I came across. They are not necessarily focusing on open source, but worth getting to know anyhow:\n TReND in Africa: Where TReND stands for Teaching and Research in Neuroscience for Development, is a initiative to stop the brain drain in sub-Saharan Africa. They are a non-profit organisation led by a small group of researchers that are training and teaching local African scientists. On top of that they also coordinate the collection of money and equipment donation to establish permanent research facilities on African universities.\n Open Stent project: Although more into medicine rather than neuroscience is the open stent project is developed by NDC. Their stent was first designed to aid customer interaction. It seems that when giving examples on design improvements, they would always bump into proprietary issues, therefore they developed their own design and made the blueprints available for everyone.\n Open source stethoscope: This is a 3D printed stethoscope, developed by Tarek Loubani, a doctor that works in Gaza and with a 3D printer and 5 dollars worth of materials (tubes, ear piece and plastic to be printed) he and his group were able to outperform the Littmann Cardiology 3, a market leader, that sells for over 20X the price of the printed one.\n Hackteria – Is a wiki page that collects several DIY projects related to Biology and Open Source Art Projects that use Biology, LifeSciences, Biotechnology. Among the projects listed are centrifuges, water baths, field microscopes.\n Open Source Lab: A project by Prof. Joshua Pearce of Michigan University. It advocates in favour of researchers building their own lab equipment using 3D printers and other “off the shelf” available items. Although the main focus of the lab are environmental problems, a lot of the solutions there stated can easily be harvested/modified for neuroscience purposes.\n e-Health sensor platform: A device created at the open source division of Libelium, called cooking hacks. It allows integration of several health related sensors (blood pressure, oxygen level, glucose level, muscle activity, airflow, galvanic response) into arduino and raspberry pi. Which can be used to make real time monitoring of patients and/or test subjects.\n Bitalino: On the same lines as e-health (above), the Bitalino is a complete platform for measurements of biosignals, but this project is more focused on learning and prototyping. It also has free software for data visualization.\n Little Devices: develops tools to improve health care and diagnostics. They are open source, and DIY.\n Public lab: Involved with environmental issues, Public lab is a platform that empowers communities to measure environmental variables around them. This way hard data concerning water, air and soil pollution can be used to put pressure on governments.\n  Open source Muon Detector: an undergraduate-level physics project that incorporates various aspects of machine- and electronics-shop technical development. The desktop muon detector is a self-contained apparatus that employs plastic scintillator as a detection medium and a silicon photomultiplier for light collection. These detectors can be used in conjunction with the provided software to make interesting physics measurements. The total cost of each counter is approximately $100.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fe223372b49426c2c8509ce332d6ab59","permalink":"https://open-neuroscience.com/en/post/other-interesting-projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/other-interesting-projects/","section":"post","summary":"It is great that there are other interesting projects out there that are also concerned with making science available to more people!

Gain, frequency, modulation and waveform type are controlled by nobs.\n   Atmel Xmega USB/Serial Arbitrary Waveform Generator runs using a boston android XMEGA evaluation board and is able to deliver square, sine, triangular and arbitrary waveforms in between 5Hz and 20kHz. This one is not a stand alone system, which means that to set a new waveform type, one would have to have the board connect to a computer at all times.\n  Simple waveform generator seems to be the most straight forward of all projects, requiring only a potentiometer, a couple of resistors and push buttons. The trade off is that with the present sketch, waveforms of only up to 170Hz can be generated. It generates sawtooth, square, triangular and sine waveforms.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d057b7b55922d4500298bb184cb5a8af","permalink":"https://open-neuroscience.com/en/post/signal-generators/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/signal-generators/","section":"post","summary":"Every lab needs a signal generator once in a while.

Other search engines, such as DuckDuckGo won’t cut it (it is much harder to find what you are looking for, especially in cases where you don’t know all specific terms). Google is a fantastic tool to find answers. But if you are new in electronic development, and in programming, or even if you are going to work in a new subfield, you may not even know what you don’t know. What to search for if you don’t know what the problem or component is called? Here I’d like to suggest YouTube. You want to get involved with Arduinos and a interesting sensor. Go and search for ‘Arduino interesting sensor’ on YouTube. There are many videos, long and short, explaining in more or less depth, more or less funny, what you can expect, and more importantly what the used components are called. I normally start by watching a few short videos to make sure that system is what I’m looking for. Afterwards, I look into several longer, deeper videos. You will get a great overview of components and alternatives regarding code and hardware.\nHere I suggest some YouTube channels that constantly output good content, going across all kind of sensors, wireless communication as well as science and hacking in a more general sense. They can also be seen as evening entertainment, for me much better than dozing off to some soap opera.\n ElectroBOOM https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0-OtVpF0wOKEqT2Z1HEtA\nMehdi Sadaghdar, the protagonist of this channel explains in a very unique way how not to get electrocuted in any possible way. It trains the viewer what to keep in mind when working with electronics. There are many ways to fry your circuit, he will show them all in a entertaining way. It seems repetitive after a whole but that will just help your brain to keep those bullet points!\n GreatScott https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6mIxFTvXkWQVEHPsEdflzQ\nBasic arduino and electronic projects, mosty day to day useful and very reproducible. His series ‘Electronics Basics’ explains fantastically electronic components like transistors and diodes to name a few. Easy to digest and a lot can be learned.\n Cody’s Lab https://www.youtube.com/user/theCodyReeder/videos\nCody is the Nr 1 in entertaining education on YouTube. He does all kind of experiments from geology, chemistry biology to gardening and everything in between. His passion is infectious and his style not teachy at all, you just tag along a fun quarter hour of science and ideas.\n Afrotechmods https://www.youtube.com/user/Afrotechmods\nA nice source for Arduino knowledge and inspiration! Great videos about basic electronics and some basic elements like power supplies, LEDs and transistors as well. There are well explained circuits about filters and op amps for example.\n Marco Reps https://www.youtube.com/user/reppesis/videos\nA very diverse set of videos about electronics and hacking with great explanations. A good source for inspiration and entertainment, oscilloscopes, lasers and soldering are some of his main topics.\n Applied Science https://www.youtube.com/user/bkraz333/videos\nIMHO the most advanced scientist on YouTube. X-ray, water cutter, electron microscopy and others, in depth explanation how he build or hacked several machines that seem way to complex / delicate to open up. His reverse engineering skills are helpful, it applies to how we could approach devices when we want to fix or understand them.\n The Thought Emporium https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChemlife/videos\nA group of scientists hacking advanced scientific machinery with household items, listening to satellites, dry freezing, fluorescence dyes and how to become a cyborg.\n The Post Apocalyptic Inventor https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDbWmfrwmzn1ZsGgrYRUxoA/videos\nHe hacks household items to harvest their motors and other hard to come by components.

Andreas gives very well structured and explained lectures about the ESP32, an Arduino with WiFi and other wireless capabilities. He enlightens every aspect about hardware and software on this topic. There are also many videos about all kind of interesting sensors.\n EEVblog https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog/videos\nI will be honest, the videos are really long and very deep and technical. But if you need some information on a specific topic and his channel has a relevant video, that video will contain all the information you will need. If you are already trying to get into PCB design, watch his videos, all of them, over and over again, you will pick up all the rules and tricks to keep im mind when designing yourself.\n bitluni’s lab https://www.youtube.com/user/bitlunislab/videos\nGood videos about Arduino in the world of internet of things, making electronics in your house remote controlled and automatic will nicely translate into the lab as well.\n AvE https://www.youtube.com/user/arduinoversusevil/videos\nEntertainment in the first place, but be aware of his potty mouth, not everyone likes it. If you do, keep on watching. He mostly dissembles power tools and evaluates their build with focus on the machine engineering side – is the housing sufficiently stable, and electronically, are the components capable of what the label advertises? After a good amount of videos you get a good grasp on how engineering works in general, how they think. He helps to understand that you don’t need to be afraid to open up devices if they break or if you want to interfere with them. there are patterns and regularities that make all those machines somewhat self explanatory.\n ForceTronics https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNd_fNspAczm8UoE2ay7K1Q/videos\nFrom easy to advanced and mostly around Arduino and PCB design, also really good videos about soldering including helpful tips on SMD soldering. All ind of tutorials about sensors and times, protocols and wifi stuff.\n Tom Scott https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay/videos\nNo Arduino, no electronics just science and curiosity. Short professionally produced videos about various topics space, computers, technology, science and more.\n If you know all of that already … KerryWong https://www.youtube.com/user/KerryWongBlog/videos\nLots of interesting and exotic laboratory electronics testing equipment and some more basic videos.\n TheSignalPath https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSignalPathBlog/videos\nReally professional high frequency stuff, loang and in depth. if you are into that or you just want to see realy sexy PCBs give it a go!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d296508f6ca0c5c1cc42eb9aa763bad4","permalink":"https://open-neuroscience.com/en/post/youtube_as_a_resource_for_open_science_hardware/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/youtube_as_a_resource_for_open_science_hardware/","section":"post","summary":"When working with Open Hardware, Google search will become your friend, whether you want it or not.
