iElectrodes is an open-source Matlab toolbox to localize intracranial electrodes from MRI and CT images. Atlas and brain surfaces can be easily loaded for anatomical labeling. 
The toolbox is capable of working with ECoG (subdural grids and strips) and SEEG (depth) electrodes. Brain-shift compensation algorithms can be applied to ECoG.
