      <title>Crowd funding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many other things that are being decentralized with the advent of the internet, so is research. One of the very things being decentralized is the funding source for research projects. This movement is called crowdfunding, and it is already present and strong for other areas, such as funding of technological, and social projects. They are organized via specialised websites that puts people needing funding with people who are willing to support it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is somewhat simple. Researchers make a video of what their project/research idea is and ask for a certain value to fund the project. If people find the idea interesting they make a donation via the website hosting that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are normally two types of funding options, fixed, where the researchers only get the money pledged if the donations reach that value (or pass it, and if the minimum is not reached the money is returned to the pledgers), or variable where the researchers get to keep the money raised even if it didn’t reach the amount pledged for. In both cases the website keeps a percentage of the money raised in case the funding is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles about it can be founded 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/nov/11/science-research-funding-crowdfunding-excellence&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nyas.org/publications/EBriefings/Detail.aspx?cid=82c4e4b4-f200-49b3-b333-c41e1e2f46aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some crowdfunding sources are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencestarter.de/&#34;&gt;http://www.sciencestarter.de/&lt;/a&gt; – Research crowdfunding portal based in germany&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://experiment.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.microryza.com/&lt;/a&gt; – Research crowdFunding portal based in the US. (update – this is now called experiment.com)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/?ref=nav&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.kickstarter.com&lt;/a&gt; – A Crowdfunding portal that also works for science projects. Currently (as in 02.02.14) only for projects based on the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indiegogo.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.indiegogo.com&lt;/a&gt; Also a crowdfunding portal that has science related projects. Differently from kickstarter, they support projects from all over the world, except countries in the US OFAC sanctions list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crowdsupply.com/&#34;&gt;https://www.crowdsupply.com/&lt;/a&gt; is another crowdfunding portal, based in the US, that focus on product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ulule.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.ulule.com/&lt;/a&gt; – A crowdfunding portal based in Europe. They have a nice post on 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ulule.com/post/700805254/a-brief-history-of-crowdfunding?_ga=1.104969667.1799200825.1396358648&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;crowdfunding history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petridish.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.petridish.org&lt;/a&gt; Research crowdfunding portal, but it seems that they haven’t been taking new projects for a while (since February 2013)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sciflies.org/about&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciflies.org&#34;&gt;www.sciflies.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – Research crowdfunding portal based in Florida, their differential is that all projects posted there have to be approved by an anonymous peer review process, currently done by the American Association for Advancement of science. And 100% of the money goes to the project, there are no administrative fees. It was not clear from the website if only US based projects are funded&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rockethub.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.rockethub.com/&lt;/a&gt; – General crowdfunding portal, that has also a science division where everyone can start a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://scifundchallenge.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;scifundchallenge.org&lt;/a&gt; – Built and maintained by the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://opensciencefederation.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;open science federation&lt;/a&gt;, this project has three main “departments”, all trying to bridge the gap in between science and the general public: Teach and encourage scientists to outreach, connect the public directly with scientists and science crowdfund.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interesting projects</title>
      <link>https://open-neuroscience.com/en/post/other-interesting-projects/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://open-neuroscience.com/en/post/other-interesting-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is great that there are other interesting projects out there that are also concerned with making science available to more people! Here is a short list of projects I came across. They are not necessarily focusing on open source, but worth getting to know anyhow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://trendinafrica.org/who-are-we/our-mission/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TReND in Africa&lt;/a&gt;: Where TReND stands for Teaching and Research in Neuroscience for Development, is a initiative to stop the brain drain in sub-Saharan Africa. They are a non-profit organisation led by a small group of researchers that are training and teaching local African scientists. On top of that they also coordinate the collection of money and equipment donation to establish permanent research facilities on African universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cbonsig/open-stent&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Stent project&lt;/a&gt;: Although more into medicine rather than neuroscience is the open stent project is developed by 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nitinol.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NDC&lt;/a&gt;. Their stent was first designed to aid customer interaction. It seems that when giving examples on design improvements, they would always bump into proprietary issues, therefore they developed their own design and made the blueprints available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GliaX/Stethoscope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open source stethoscope:&lt;/a&gt; This is a 3D printed stethoscope, developed by Tarek Loubani, a doctor that works in Gaza and with a 3D printer and 5 dollars worth of materials (tubes, ear piece and plastic to be printed) he and his group were able to outperform the Littmann Cardiology 3, a market leader, that sells for over 20X the price of the printed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://hackteria.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hackteria&lt;/a&gt; – Is a wiki page that collects several DIY projects related to Biology and Open Source Art Projects that use Biology, LifeSciences, Biotechnology. Among the projects listed are centrifuges, water baths, field microscopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Source Lab:&lt;/a&gt;   A project by Prof. Joshua Pearce of Michigan University. It advocates in favour of researchers building their own lab equipment using 3D printers and other “off the shelf” available items. Although the main focus of the lab are environmental problems, a lot of the solutions there stated can easily be harvested/modified for neuroscience purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cooking-hacks.com/documentation/tutorials/ehealth-biometric-sensor-platform-arduino-raspberry-pi-medical&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;e-Health sensor platform&lt;/a&gt;: A device created at the open source division of Libelium, called cooking hacks. It allows integration of several health related sensors (blood pressure, oxygen level, glucose level, muscle activity, airflow, galvanic response) into arduino and raspberry pi. Which can be used to make real time monitoring of patients and/or test subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bitalino.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bitalino&lt;/a&gt;: On the same lines as e-health (above), the Bitalino is a complete platform for measurements of biosignals, but this project is more focused on learning and prototyping. It also has free software for data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://littledevices.org/research/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Little Devices&lt;/a&gt;: develops tools to improve health care and diagnostics. They are open source, and DIY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://publiclab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Public lab&lt;/a&gt;: Involved with environmental issues, Public lab is a platform that empowers communities to measure environmental variables around them. This way hard data concerning water, air and soil pollution can be used to put pressure on governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01196&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open source Muon Detector:&lt;/a&gt; an undergraduate-level physics project that incorporates various aspects of machine- and electronics-shop technical development. The desktop muon detector is a self-contained apparatus that employs plastic scintillator as a detection medium and a silicon photomultiplier for light collection. These detectors can be used in conjunction with the provided software to make interesting physics measurements. The total cost of each counter is approximately $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open notebooks&lt;/a&gt; are opening up science in the very first steps, making records of ideas, plans that didn’t work and protocols that failed available publicly. This allows others to avoid trailing the same dead end roads, saving time, money and human power. Some examples are listed below, but unfortunately there weren’t enough examples in the neuroscience field (until 22/01/14), so examples from all fields are listed:&lt;/p&gt;
