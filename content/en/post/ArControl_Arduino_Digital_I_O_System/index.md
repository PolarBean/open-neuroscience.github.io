ArControl is a Arduino based digital signals control system. A special application for ArControl is to establish a animal behavioral platform (as Skinner box), which control devices to deliver stimulation, monitor behavioral response and record data. ArControl is also a signal generator for Optogenetic TTL pulses. The software provides a friendly GUI without need to master low-level programming.
