Movement is a a Python toolbox for analysing body movements across space and time, to aid the study of animal behaviour in neuroscience.

Pose estimation tools, such as DeepLabCut and SLEAP are now commonplace when processing video data of animal behaviour. There is not yet a standardised, easy-to-use way to process the pose tracks produced from these software packages.

movement aims to provide a consistent modular interface to analyse pose tracks, allowing steps such as data cleaning, visualisation and motion quantification. We aim to support a range of pose estimation packages, along with 2D or 3D tracking of single or multiple individuals.
