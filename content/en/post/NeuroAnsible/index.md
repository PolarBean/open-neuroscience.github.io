NeuroAnsible is a software installation system to take an Ubuntu LTS desktop and turn it into a Neuroimaging workstation. NeuroAnsible installs software in a module system similar to those available on large HPCs, aiming to be minimally invasive to the underlying system. The software allows selective installation via tags, and upgrades to install new packages while maintaining older installs side-by-side as NeuroAnsible is upgraded.
