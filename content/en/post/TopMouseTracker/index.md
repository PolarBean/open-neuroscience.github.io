TopMouseTacker is a Python library based on OpenCV made for object tracking in videos. It uses a color camera and depth camera to infer the position of objects in the arena. It registers both the images to allow tracking the animal in the arena and the target objects' height. It can use this information to classify behavior, for example "nesting".
