The COGAIN Association aims to promote research and development in the field of gaze-based interaction in computer-aided communication and control. Computer applications can be controlled by gazing at the computer screen. For people with disabilities, gaze controlled applications have been largely used for communication, entertainment, education, and many other purposes.
