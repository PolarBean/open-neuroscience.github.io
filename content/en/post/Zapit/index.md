Zapit is a general purpose package for coordinating galvo-based optostimulation in head-fixed mice. It is a software and hardware solution with an emphasis on flexibility and ease of use. The software will run on a variety of hardware designs and experimental paradigms. A user-friendly MATLAB GUI handles creation of stimulus sets, scanner calibration, and alignment of stereotaxic coordinates to the sample. The experiment itself is run via a MATLAB API: using a small number of simple commands the user can initiate and stop optostimulation, and handle trial logging to disk. There is a Python wrapper for the MATLAB API and support for presenting stimuli in other programming languages.
