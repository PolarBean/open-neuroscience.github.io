This simple optogenetics stimulation driver is based on the Arduino Uno, and produces millisecond-accurate timing to control a single laser or LED. The dials allow easy control of pulse on-time and frequency, with a simple switch to turn the flashing on or off.

I am perpetually annoyed by the over-engineering of neuroscience research technology - creating expense and difficulty for the end user when it is not needed. I developed with TTL driver for my own usage, with the only goal being to make it easy for anyone to use. 

The prototype is currently being used on one of our electrophysiology rigs to drive flashing of the LED for optogenetic stimulation.
